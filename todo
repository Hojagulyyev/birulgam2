- refactor: add table constraints to repository class as constants
- perf: use validate method instead __post_init__ method validation from entity,
    and use that validate method only in repo save() method
- refactor: make AppError class in application layer instead of api layer
- fix: validate CreateDealUsecaseDto. eg: must remaining_mount <= total_amount
- fix: validate fkey constraint errors. eg: create_deal_usecase should handle deal_store_id_fkey (not exist)
